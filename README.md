# World time map

World current time map with timezones and sunrise/sunset info

## Description

[Demo](https://z3ut.github.io/world-time-map)

Site uses [tz-lookup](https://github.com/darkskyapp/tz-lookup) for timezone determination, [suncalc](https://github.com/mourner/suncalc) for sunrise/sunset calculation, [moment-timezone](https://momentjs.com/timezone/) for local time computation. Cities and coordinates taken from [simplemaps](https://simplemaps.com/data/world-cities).

Don't rely on this site for important time tracking or timezone detecting, it provides only approximate data.
